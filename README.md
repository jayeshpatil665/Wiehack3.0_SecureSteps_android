<h2>Abstract</h2>
<br>
Women safety is a very important issue due to rising crimes against women these days. 
Presently there is indeed no good solution to this problem. The existing applications and 
devices are not much effective as they need lot of human interaction to operate. In this project 
we are doing implement on app which will help for women safety. The app will be designed 
keeping in mind the concept of personal safety. It incorporates all the essential features such 
as GPS, contact numbers, messages, time, voice codes, nearest safe station, alarm and so 
on. The app can also be used in case of an accident, harassment, robbery or any natural 
calamities. In a problematic situation if the user raises the save our souls alert from the app, 
the location, message alert will be directly transmitted to that person who the user added to 
their two contact on a app so they can able to reach the location.
